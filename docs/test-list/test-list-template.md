# Test List Template for TDD Workflow

## Purpose and Usage

This document serves as a template for creating test lists to guide Test-Driven Development (TDD) in this project. It helps developers organize and plan tests before implementation, ensuring comprehensive coverage and a structured approach.

Test lists are categorized into:

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components or with external systems.

Each test case should be described clearly with the following format:

- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for the test case (e.g., UT-001, IT-001)
- **Title**: Brief descriptive title of the test case
- **Preconditions**: Any setup or state required before running the test
- **Test Steps**: Step-by-step actions to perform the test
- **Expected Result**: The expected outcome or behavior after test execution
- **Notes**: Additional information, edge cases, or references

## TDD Cycle Guide

1. **Write Tests (Red)**
   Write a failing test that defines a desired improvement or new function.

2. **Make Tests Pass (Green)**
   Implement the minimal code needed to pass the test.

3. **Refactor**
   Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass.

Repeat this cycle for each new feature or bug fix.

## Common Test Patterns and Examples

- **Validation Tests**: Check input validation and error messages.
- **Error Handling Tests**: Ensure proper handling of exceptions and error responses.
- **Boundary Value Tests**: Test edge cases and limits of input ranges.
- **State Transition Tests**: Verify correct behavior when changing states.
- **Performance Tests**: (Optional) Check response times and resource usage.

## Guidelines for Mocks and Stubs

- Use mocks to simulate external dependencies or services.
- Use stubs to provide predefined responses for functions or methods.
- Keep mocks and stubs focused and minimal to avoid overcomplicating tests.
- Reset mocks between tests to avoid state leakage.

## Unit Tests Template Example

- [ ] UT-001: Validate user input for login
  - Preconditions: User service running
  - Test Steps: Submit invalid login credentials
  - Expected Result: Receive validation error message
  - Notes: Covers empty password

- [ ] UT-002: Check JWT token generation
  - Preconditions: Valid user credentials
  - Test Steps: Request token generation
  - Expected Result: Token is returned and valid
  - Notes:

## Integration Tests Template Example

- [ ] IT-001: User registration flow
  - Preconditions: Database initialized
  - Test Steps: Submit registration API request
  - Expected Result: User created and response 201
  - Notes: Includes email verification

- [ ] IT-002: Subscription API endpoint
  - Preconditions: User logged in
  - Test Steps: Call subscription list endpoint
  - Expected Result: Returns list of subscriptions
  - Notes: Tests pagination

This template should be copied and adapted for each new feature or module to maintain consistency and clarity in test planning.
