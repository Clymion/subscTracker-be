# Test List: Environment Configuration Management

## Feature Description
Environment configuration management with validation using pydantic-settings. This feature ensures that environment variables and .env file settings are loaded, validated, and accessible in a type-safe manner.

## Related Requirements
- REQ-ENV-001: Load environment variables from .env file and system environment.
- REQ-ENV-002: Validate required configuration fields with appropriate types.
- REQ-ENV-003: Provide default values for optional configuration fields.
- REQ-ENV-004: Raise clear validation errors for missing or invalid configuration.
- REQ-ENV-005: Configuration should be accessible as a singleton throughout the application.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

#### Config Class
- [ ] Test environment variables are correctly loaded into the config class.
- [ ] Test missing required environment variables raise validation errors.
- [ ] Test invalid type environment variables raise validation errors.
- [ ] Test default values are applied when optional variables are not set.
- [ ] Test config attributes have correct types and expected values.
- [ ] Test loading config multiple times returns consistent results.

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test config loading with actual .env file in development environment.
- [ ] Test config loading with overridden environment variables.

## Implementation Approach
1. Define a pydantic BaseSettings subclass in `app/config.py` with all required and optional fields.
2. Use environment variable names and default values in the class.
3. Implement a singleton pattern or module-level instance for global access.
4. Write unit tests in `tests/unit/test_config.py` covering all validation and loading scenarios.
5. Validate behavior with integration tests simulating different environment setups.

## Dependencies
- pydantic
- python-dotenv (if needed for .env loading)

## Estimated Effort
Small (2 story points)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All unit tests pass with 100% coverage.
- Validation errors are clear and informative.
- Configuration is accessible and consistent across the app.
- Documentation is updated to reflect configuration usage.
