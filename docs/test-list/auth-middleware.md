# Test List: Common Authentication and Authorization Middleware

## Feature Description
Middleware to handle JWT validation and permission checks for protected API routes, ensuring secure access control.

## Related Requirements
- REQ-001: Validate JWT access tokens on protected endpoints
- REQ-002: Reject requests with expired, malformed, or missing tokens
- REQ-003: Enforce user permissions and roles for authorization
- REQ-004: Provide consistent error responses for authentication failures
- REQ-005: Support refresh token validation and renewal

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

#### JWT Validation
- [ ] Test valid JWT token allows access
- [ ] Test expired JWT token returns 401 Unauthorized with TOKEN_EXPIRED message
- [ ] Test malformed JWT token returns 401 Unauthorized with appropriate error
- [ ] Test missing JWT token returns 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Test refresh token validation success
- [ ] Test refresh token expired or invalid returns 401 Unauthorized

#### Authorization Checks
- [ ] Test user with sufficient permissions can access protected resource
- [ ] Test user without required permissions receives 403 Forbidden with INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS message
- [ ] Test role-based access control enforcement

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Test error responses conform to standardized JSON format
- [ ] Test error messages use centralized constants

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test middleware integration with Flask routes
- [ ] Test middleware correctly intercepts unauthorized requests
- [ ] Test refresh token endpoint issues new access and refresh tokens

## Implementation Approach
1. Implement JWT validation middleware using flask-jwt-extended decorators and custom checks
2. Implement permission and role checks as decorators or middleware functions
3. Integrate error handling with common error handlers
4. Write unit and integration tests based on this test list

## Dependencies
- flask-jwt-extended
- app/constants.py for error messages
- app/common/error_handlers.py for error response formatting

## Estimated Effort
Small to Medium (3-5 story points)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- Middleware correctly validates tokens and enforces permissions
- Error responses are consistent and informative
- Refresh token flow works as specified in API documentation
