# Test List: Common Authentication and Authorization Middleware

## Feature Description
Middleware to handle JWT validation and permission checks for protected API routes, ensuring secure access control.

## Related Requirements
- REQ-001: Validate JWT access tokens on protected endpoints
- REQ-002: Reject requests with expired, malformed, or missing tokens
- REQ-003: Enforce user permissions and roles for authorization
- REQ-004: Provide consistent error responses for authentication failures
- REQ-005: Support refresh token validation and renewal

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

#### JWT Validation
- [x] Test valid JWT token allows access
- [x] Test expired JWT token returns 401 Unauthorized with TOKEN_EXPIRED message
- [x] Test malformed JWT token returns 401 Unauthorized with appropriate error
- [x] Test missing JWT token returns 401 Unauthorized
- [x] Test invalid authorization header format returns 401 Unauthorized
- [x] Test different users can access protected routes with valid tokens
- [x] Test token with different user identities
- [x] Test bearer token case sensitivity handling

#### Authorization Checks
- [x] Test user with sufficient permissions can access protected resource
- [x] Test user without required permissions receives 403 Forbidden with INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS message
- [x] Test specific user permission checks
- [x] Test multiple permitted roles can access the same route
- [x] Test complex permission logic (admin or specific prefix)

#### Error Handling
- [x] Test error responses conform to standardized JSON format
- [x] Test error messages use centralized constants
- [x] Test authentication error response format includes all required fields
- [x] Test permission error response format includes all required fields

#### Middleware Chain Order
- [x] Test auth middleware executes before permission middleware
- [x] Test invalid token fails at auth level before permission check
- [x] Test valid token but no permission fails at permission level

### Integration Tests

- [x] Test middleware integration with Flask routes
- [x] Test middleware correctly intercepts unauthorized requests
- [x] Test protected routes allow access to unprotected endpoints
- [x] Test permission-protected routes still require authentication

## Implementation Approach
1. ✅ Implement JWT validation middleware using flask-jwt-extended decorators and custom checks
2. ✅ Implement permission and role checks as decorators or middleware functions
3. ✅ Integrate error handling with common error handlers
4. ✅ Write unit and integration tests based on this test list

## Dependencies
- ✅ flask-jwt-extended
- ✅ app/constants.py for error messages
- ✅ app/common/error_handlers.py for error response formatting

## Estimated Effort
Small to Medium (3-5 story points)

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- ✅ Middleware correctly validates tokens and enforces permissions
- ✅ Error responses are consistent and informative
- ✅ Refresh token flow works as specified in API documentation

## Implementation Status
**COMPLETED** - All tests implemented and passing. Middleware provides robust JWT validation and permission checking with proper error handling.
