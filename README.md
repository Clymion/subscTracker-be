# Project README

## Project Overview and Objectives

This project is a Python-based web API service designed to provide robust and scalable functionality with a focus on maintainability, security, and testability. The primary objectives are to deliver a well-structured RESTful API with JWT authentication, comprehensive error handling, and a clean modular architecture that supports rapid development and easy extension.

## System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **API Layer**: Implements RESTful endpoints using Flask Blueprints, organized by version and functionality.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations between API and data layers.
- **Data Layer**: Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions, with clearly defined models and migrations.
- **Common Layer**: Shared utilities such as error handling, authentication, and configuration.
- **Testing Layer**: Structured tests including unit, integration, and API tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Environment Setup Instructions

### Required Software

- Python 3.13
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- PostgreSQL or compatible relational database
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Poetry if not already installed:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```
3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Development Environment Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Poetry handles this automatically):
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
2. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update database credentials and other settings.
3. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Test Execution Instructions

- Run all tests with pytest:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Generate coverage report:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
  ```

## API Development Guidelines

- Use Flask Blueprints to organize API endpoints by version and feature.
- Follow RESTful principles with appropriate HTTP methods.
- Protect endpoints with JWT authentication using `@jwt_required()` decorator.
- Use centralized error handling with custom exceptions and global error handlers.
- Write clear and consistent docstrings following Google style.
- Use type hints for all functions and methods.

## Naming Conventions and Coding Standards

- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and file names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Follow PEP 8 style guide with a max line length of 100 characters.
- Use Google style docstrings.
- Include type hints for all functions and methods.
- Commit messages follow the format: `{type}({scope}): {message}` (e.g., `feat(api): add user login endpoint`).
